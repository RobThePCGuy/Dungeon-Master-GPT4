Here is the full output from a GPT-4 game. The only issue I keep having is the DM forgetting simple things, like in this example, towards the end, when it fights once with a warhammer and the second time with a staff. Also, the recap at the end of the quest is not right at all. Alas, I guess there is a limit to the current system. Additionally, the safety limits imposed by OpenAI keep the game from really getting interesting.
