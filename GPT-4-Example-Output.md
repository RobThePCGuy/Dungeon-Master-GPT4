Clearice carefully examines the ancient stone pedestal. Overgrown with moss and ivy, it bears the weathered markings of time. As you brush away the vegetation, you reveal a set of inscriptions etched into the stone, written in an ancient language. Fortunately, due to your scholarly training as a Cleric, you recognize it as Celestial, the language of divine and heavenly beings.

The inscriptions, though partially eroded, speak of a guardian spirit bound within the crystal, awaiting a worthy soul to set it free. A warning follows, hinting at a great ordeal that shall befall those who attempt to release the spirit without pure intentions.

Suddenly, the crystal sphere shatters, and a radiant entity emerges. The spirit is a seraph, a celestial being of great power and benevolence. It nods at you, its form shimmering with ethereal light.

"Thank you, mortal. I have been trapped for centuries," it speaks in a melodious voice. "As a token of my gratitude, I grant you my blessing." A warm energy washes over Clearice, and she feels her divine magic strengthen.

With the seraph's boon upon her, Clearice gathers her belongings and begins her journey towards the distant town, walking through the moonlit forest. The path is narrow and uneven, snaking through thick undergrowth and towering trees. A symphony of nocturnal creatures echoes around her, their calls a constant reminder of the wilderness she traverses.

After some time, she spots the warm, inviting glow of a bonfire in the distance. Clearice approaches it and finds a makeshift campsite with a solitary tent pitched nearby. She sees a figure huddled by the fire, engrossed in the intricate carvings on a piece of wood.

Clearice thanks Brom and takes a seat next to the fire. Its warmth seeps into her, relaxing her muscles and soothing the fatigue of her journey. Brom resumes his carving, the rhythmic scraping of his knife against wood filling the silence.

After a while, Brom puts down his carving and pulls out a pair of skewered rabbits from his satchel. He places them over the fire to cook. The tantalizing aroma of roasting meat fills the air. Brom turns to Clearice, "I've got extra if you're hungry."

The night passes peacefully, with Clearice taking the opportunity to rest and regain her strength for the journey ahead.

As he speaks, he sketches a quick map in the dirt with his carving knife, indicating important landmarks and forks in the path. Clearice studies the impromptu map, committing it to memory.

The town is quaint, a smattering of buildings nestled amidst the rolling landscape. A cobblestone path weaves through the town, leading to a bustling market square.

Clearice, moved by the villagers' concerns, offers to help with the goblin problem. The villagers look at her with surprise, then admiration. Their gratitude is palpable as they thank her profusely.

The village elder, a sturdy woman named Mabel, provides Clearice with directions to the most afflicted farm and details about the goblins' activities. "They've been stealing crops, frightening livestock, and even attacking farmers who try to protect their lands," Mabel explains, her face drawn with worry.

Clearice feels a sense of purpose as she decides to tackle this problem head-on. A new quest has taken form, and she is ready to face it.

Determined to help the villagers, Clearice bids them farewell and sets off towards the farm. Guided by Mabel's detailed directions, she makes her way through the winding dirt roads and lush green fields that lead to the outskirts of Elmsworth.

After a brief journey, Clearice arrives at the troubled farm. It's a humble plot of land with a quaint farmhouse, a barn, and several crop fields. However, signs of trouble are evident. She can see trampled crops, scattered tools, and a general air of tension.

Clearice decides to search for goblin tracks around the farm. Using her natural Elf perception, she carefully examines the ground around the trampled crops and scattered tools. After a few moments of careful observation, she spots a set of small, clawed footprints leading from the fields towards the woods.

The footprints appear to be fresh, hinting that the goblins have been here recently. Clearice feels a surge of determination. The tracks could potentially lead her to the goblins' hideout.

Clearice decides to follow the goblin tracks into the woods. As she ventures into the dense, towering trees, she stays alert, her senses heightened to catch any movement or sound. The tracks lead her deeper into the forest, where the light from the sun is obscured by the interweaving branches and leaves above.

Suddenly, she hears a faint rustling sound in the underbrush ahead. Peering through the trees, she sees a group of small figures huddled together. Their grotesque, greenish features and ragged clothing are unmistakable. Clearice has found the goblins.

Clearice decides to seize the opportunity and launches a surprise attack on the goblins. She swiftly moves from her hiding spot, brandishing her warhammer. The goblins, caught off guard, scatter in surprise.

With a powerful swing, Clearice strikes the nearest goblin. It howls in pain and stumbles back, clearly hurt. The others, now aware of her presence, draw their crude weapons and prepare to fight.

With precision and strength, Clearice swings her warhammer once more at Goblin 1. The goblin, already reeling from the previous blow, fails to evade the attack. With a resounding thud, the goblin is thrown back, motionless. It's clear that it won't be getting up.

Clearice, spurred on by her previous victory, turns her attention to Goblin 2. She swings her warhammer, aiming for the creature. The goblin tries to dodge, but Clearice's swing is too swift and too strong. The blow lands solidly, sending the goblin sprawling backward.

The third goblin, looking fearful, starts to back away, its gaze darting between its fallen comrade and Clearice.

Seeing that Goblin 2 is still conscious, Clearice swings her warhammer once again. This time, the goblin is too dazed to dodge, and the hammer connects with a sickening thud. Goblin 2 collapses, unmoving, alongside its fallen companion.

Clearice takes a calming breath and speaks to the goblin in as friendly a manner as she can muster. "Lead me to your camp, goblin. You have my word you won't be harmed."

Clearice opts for silence, deciding to simply follow the goblin as they delve deeper into the forest.

Clearice continues to follow the goblin, eyes and ears alert. The undergrowth thickens, yet the goblin navigates it with ease, showing Clearice the safest path through. After what feels like an hour of walking, the trees part to reveal a small clearing. It's here the goblin stops, pointing towards what appears to be a hidden entrance to a cave.

Choosing to trust the goblin, Clearice follows him into the cave. The entrance is narrow but it widens as they move further in. The interior is damp, with the scent of earth and moss filling the air. Faint light filters in from cracks in the ceiling, revealing rough stone walls and the echo of dripping water. After a few minutes of navigating through the dimly lit cave, they emerge into a wider cavern, where a small community of goblins is set up.

Clearice decides to take a bold approach. She steps forward, challenging Grukk to a fight, aiming to free the goblins from what she perceives as his tyranny. An eerie silence fills the cave as all eyes turn to the celestial elf. Grukk grunts, then breaks into a wide, toothy grin. "Bold! I like that," he chuckles, unsheathing a wicked looking blade. The fight is on.
